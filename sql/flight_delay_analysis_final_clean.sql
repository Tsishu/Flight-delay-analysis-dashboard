-- üõ´ FLIGHT DELAY ANALYSIS DASHBOARD - COMPLETE PROJECT üõ´
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- üìä WHAT THIS DOES:
-- This SQL script creates all the data needed for your Tableau dashboard
-- It analyzes flight delays from 2020-2023 and creates 3 main charts:
--   1. Airline Performance Ranking (which airlines are best/worst)
--   2. Monthly Trends (when delays happen most)
--   3. Yearly Overview (how delays changed over time)
--
-- üéØ GOAL: Help people understand flight delay patterns and choose better airlines
-- üìÖ DATA PERIOD: 2020-2023 (most recent and relevant data)
-- üè¢ FOCUS: Major US airlines with meaningful delays (>10 minutes)
-- 
-- =====================================================

-- =====================================================
-- üîç SECTION 1: LET'S EXPLORE YOUR DATA FIRST
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- Before we start building charts, let's understand what data we have
-- Think of this like checking what ingredients you have before cooking!
--

-- üìã STEP 1: See what tables are in your database
-- (This is like looking in your kitchen to see what's available)
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

-- üìã STEP 2: Check the structure of your flights table
-- (This shows us what columns we have - like checking a recipe's ingredients list)
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'flights_delay';

-- üìã STEP 3: Count how many flight records we have
-- (This tells us how much data we're working with)
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rows FROM flights_delay;

-- =====================================================
-- üöÄ SECTION 2: CLEAN UP AND OPTIMIZE THE DATA
-- =====================================================
-- 
-- Your original data might have millions of rows, but we don't need all of them
-- Let's create a smaller, cleaner dataset that focuses on what matters most
-- Think of this like filtering your music playlist to only your favorite songs!
--

-- üóëÔ∏è First, let's remove any old version of this table (if it exists)

-- ‚ú® Now let's create our clean, optimized dataset

-- Think of this like saving your work so you can open it in another program!
